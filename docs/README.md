# Requirements

These docs use [`mermaid`](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).

Please install the vscode extensions suggested in this workspace to preview and edit nicely in vscode.

To view the diagrams directly in web, [use this extension for now](https://github.com/BackMarket/github-mermaid-extension) (until GitHub implements [this feature](https://github.community/t/feature-request-support-mermaid-markdown-graph-diagrams-in-md-files/1922/2)). 

Enjoy!
